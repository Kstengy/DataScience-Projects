These are the answers to the Airbnb challenge

Q1 - What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?
a1 - the most expensive 1 night listing is a 1 bedroom townhouse in the Gold Coast. Having lived in Chi for 5 years I can confirm this 
makes a lot of sense.

a2 - the most expensive weekly rental is a 3 bedroom apartment that holds up to 7. It is in greektown.

Q2 - What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?
a1 - There are two ways to look at this question, the first is just seeing how many listings by neighborhood which would be
Select
	listings.neighbourhood_cleansed as 'Neighborhood',
	count(listings.neighbourhood_cleansed) as 'No. of listings'
From
	listings
group by
	listings.neighbourhood_cleansed
order by
	count(listings.neighbourhood_cleansed) Desc
  
a2 - I also thought, however, that you could see what locations had the most reviews(by neighborhood) indicating how many people have
stayed there rather than just how many listings are available. This however leads to the same top 5 neighborhoods. In an effort to see
what the most reviewed neighborhoods were like I pulled the average score of the most often reviewed neighborhoods.
Select
	listings.neighbourhood_cleansed as 'Neighborhood',
	Count(listings.number_of_reviews) as 'Review counts',
	Avg(listings.review_scores_rating) as 'Avg score of reviews'
From
	listings
Where 
	listings.review_scores_rating not null
group by
	listings.neighbourhood_cleansed
order by
	Count(listings.number_of_reviews) Desc

Q3 - What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?
a1 The most expensive time to visit is in October
Select	
	strftime('%m', calendar.date) as 'Monat',
	Avg(calendar.price)
From
	calendar
Where
	length(calendar.price) > 1
group by
	strftime('%m', calendar.date)

a2 Not sure on this second part
